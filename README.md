# skill-prediction

Just added a bunch of personal changes I did over the years playing TERA to the default SP. Some of the changes probably make no sense at all and I honestly don't remember much anymore.

Not sure if there's much changes after a few patches when I quit back then but so far I've tried it on Sorc and Lancer and it works fine.

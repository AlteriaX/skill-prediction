# skill-prediction

Just added a bunch of personal changes I did over the years playing TERA to the default SP. Some of the changes probably make no sense at all and I honestly don't remember much anymore.

Not sure if there's much changes after a few patches when I quit back then.

Class tested on Menma's server:
- Archer: Not tested
- Berserker: Tested, works fine
- Brawler: Tested, works fine
- Gunner: Tested, works fine
- Lancer: Tested, works fine
- Mystic: Not tested
- Ninja: Not tested
- Priest: Tested, works fine
- Reaper: Tested, works fine
- Slayer: Not tested but I'm sure it's horrible
- Sorcerer: Tested, works fine
- Valkyrie: Not tested
- Warrior: Tested, works fine
